A fully fledged text editor built with Electron.
Flexible, minimal and comfortable text editor.

## What does it do? 
Suside is a code editor which can do in a normal editor, but there are
differences that made Suside unique.

The following features that made Suside unique are
* Built-in HTML previewer. This feature doesn't exist in other code editor and Suside has one to preview it without going into your browser for debugging.
* Console. Other code editors don't have one except IDEs. 
Here, Suside provides a console without going into your
terminal for debugging.
* Discord Rich Presence. Other code editors require you to install third-party extensions for Discord Rich Presence to see what you are working. In Suside, you don't need a third-party extension to do Discord Rich Presence, because it is built-in!

## Usage
To get started, you must have the following.
* Node.js version 7.9
* npm version 1.0.x
* Electron 13.1.17


Next, you got to clone the repository, change the directory to suside, and installing all dependencies by typing this line
```shell
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/zeankundev/suside
# Change it to suside on where we clone it
$ cd suside
# Installing all dependencies
$ npm install
```

Now, this is where all the fun begins. Type this line in your terminal after installing all the dependencies.
```shell
$ npm start
```
Have fun hacking on Suside! ðŸ¥³:tada:
