## 🤔 What does it do? 🤔
Suside is a code editor which can do in a normal editor, but there are
differences that made Suside unique.

The following features that made Suside unique are
* 💻 Built in terminal. You don't have to open your terminal, just open the built in terminal.
* 📓 Autocompletion. You don't need to type the full keyword. Just type half or partial of the keyword, then boom!
